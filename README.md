# Fraud Detection for E-commerce and Bank Transactions

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on building robust fraud detection models for both e-commerce transactions and bank credit card transactions. The goal is to accurately identify fraudulent activity while balancing the trade-off between security and user experience.

The project is developed as part of a KAIM Academy data science assignment and follows industry-standard practices for data analysis, machine learning, and model explainability.

##  Objectives
- Analyze and preprocess transaction data
- Engineer meaningful features for fraud detection
- Handle highly imbalanced datasets appropriately
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Interpret model predictions using explainability techniques (SHAP)
- Provide actionable business recommendations
